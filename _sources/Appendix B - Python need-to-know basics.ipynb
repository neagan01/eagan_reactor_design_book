    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level computing language--a way of executing and interpreting commands that prioritizes human readibility. It does not on its own really include any \"functionality\" since it is just a language. Similarly \"English\" is a language, it is not a book or a speech or a movie...it is simply a language. In order to use Python, you need \"packages\" which consist of Python codes (as well as others) that let you do useful things like math, plotting, etc.\n",
